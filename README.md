# Extended LightIDs

Show additional LightID lanes for environment enhancement.

*Only displays on the Alt+P mode.*

Extends LightIDs to the maximum ID used by any event of that type.
Also attempts (very badly) to guess event type from environment enhancement data. Works best with V3 Chroma and `ILightWithId.type` defined.
